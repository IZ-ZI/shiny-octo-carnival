# Project Background

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions have migrated to online meetings with Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc.). However, a lackof proper training to effectively deliver the quality of education as compared to in-person teaching can be observed. Therefore, our project aims to improve the effectiveness of these online meetings so that information can be processed through a designed pipeline and providestatistics and summaries of meetings.
